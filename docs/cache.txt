Caching: 
Weâ€™re currently utilizing Mongodb to store and cache the tweets for a company. 
If a user queries that company again within a 15 minute time frame, 
our app gets the cached tweets from the database and returns it. 
If there is tweets for that company in the database but they are greater than 15 minutes old,
our app makes a new call to Twitter and replaces those tweets in the database, thus we save an API call. 
We also plan on caching tweet sentiment in the database as well within a specified time frame.
